IEEE ICHI Healthcare Data 2021",IEEE ICHI2021 - 1st Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare Data for Precision Medicine,"Aug 9, 2021 - Aug 12, 2021","Canada, Victoria (online)","May 11, 2021",http://healthcaredata.gsu.edu.tr/,"Precision medicine is a revolutionary advance in current healthcare transitioning from a one-size-fits-all approach towards a data-driven where medical decisions are evidence-based on individual patient characteristics, environment, and lifestyle. Precision medicine is deeply connected to and dependent on data science, specifically machine learning which have proven during recent years to be promising in predicting disease risk from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In this context, electronic health records (EHRs) offer great promise for accelerating such predictive analysis by identifying similarities among patients based on their medical information, which is a key step in precision medicine. In addition, explanations supporting the output of a ML model are crucial in precision medicine, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary prediction for supporting their diagnosis. Therefore, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) allows healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide more personalized and precise treatments.


The general purpose of this workshop in IEEE ICHI 2021 conference is to bring together researchers, academicians and sector employees from different fields and disciplines and provide them an independent platform to exchange information on their researches, ideas and findings about healthcare data and its analytics. It is also aimed to encourage debate on how big data can effectively support the healthcare in terms of diagnosis, treatment and population health, and to develop a common understanding for research conducted in this multidisciplinary field.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

Health data collection and analysis for precision medicine
Electronic health records (EHR) mining
Pervasive and personalized healthcare information systems and services
Analysis and visualization of biological and clinical data
EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) on healthcare

2,DCAI 2021,DCAI'21: 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence,"Oct 6, 2021 - Oct 8, 2021","Salamanca, Spain","May 14, 2021",https://www.dcai-conference.net/,"The 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2021 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects, lessons, etc. associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in Salamanca (Spain) within PAAMS'21 in 6th-8th October, 2021.

Nowadays, most computing systems from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid /cloud computing systems are available for parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g. electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured during the last decade and many effective applications are now deployed. The artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, and so on is increasing and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, both industrial and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business areas is essential to facilitate the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. The technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be specially considered in this symposium.

Scope:
Knowledge Management (KM) is a discipline concerned with the analysis and technical support of practices used in an organization to identify, create, represent, distribute and enable the adoption and leveraging of good practices embedded in collaborative settings and, in particular, in organizational processes. Effective knowledge management is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage, and a key to the success of contemporary organizations, bolstering the collective expertise of its employees and partners. There are several perspectives on KM, but all share the same core components, namely: People, Processes and Technology. Some take a techno-centric focus, in order to enhance knowledge integration and creation; some take an organizational focus, in order to optimize organization design and workflows; some take an ecological focus, where the important aspects are related to people interaction, knowledge and environmental factors as a complex adaptive system similar to a natural ecosystem. An information system (IS) is an organized system for the collection, organization, storage and communication of information. This is of paramount importance to manage organized activities in any kind of enterprise, often referred to as knowledge management (KM), i.e. a multidisciplinary approach to achieve organizational objectives by making the best use of knowledge to support operations, management and decision-making. KMIS aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and application of all perspectives of Knowledge Management and Information Systems.
